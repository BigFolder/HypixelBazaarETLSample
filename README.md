# HypixelBazaarETLSample
# Sample ETL Process for Hypixel's Bazaar API

## This is an example of ETL not using airflow :(

In order to run this you'll need to run ./Models/Models64Bit.py to build the models in sklearn.
Since your Computer Arch. may differ from mine it has to be this way.

### you need to add your Credentials into your .env File as well. DON'T FORGET THIS PART! 
### While this was intended for a couple of people in particular, anyone can utilize this if you want to of course :) 

### Any questions, just ask me via here or via discord. Squiddy#7584
